_Web Search Engine Project for CompSci 121 at UC Irvine_
# Web Search Engine 
There are two parts in this project. The first part is a web crawler that can search a website and retrieve all valid URLs. The second part is the search engine, which builds a search index and stores it on a MongoDB cloud database. Finally, from a user's query, the search engine returns top ranked web pages using TF-IDF algorithm.
